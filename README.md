This is my submission for the Helicarrier code challenge. It basically displays residents of different earths from the Rick and Morty API from [here](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/rick-and-morty-a3b90u/explorer?variant=current) inspired by the Rick n' Morty cartoon series. 

Basically I decided to use Vite to generate my react app because it build much faster than the create-react-app package. This helped increase my productivity because I was able to view my progress instantly while building the application unlike when I develop react apps that are generated from the create-react-app package. For the API I settled on the Rick and Morty API since it was a nice go to API to be able to mock the functionality of my application. For the styling I settled for Tailwindcss because it enables me to write less css and focus on making the app to work with a nice UI.

For the search functionality, you can be able to search for a specific character say Rick and get all the ricks in different earths. For the filters I was not really ablr to get a hold of it because it was kinda challenging for me but I am learning how to implement in and will implement it in the solution.
